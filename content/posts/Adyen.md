Position: Data Engineer Intern <br>
This is part of the <a href="https://cityscholars.grainger.illinois.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">city scholars program</a> at UIUC where I am a full-time student taking 15 credit hours while working a part-time internship fully in person in Chicago! 
I had to apply for the program itself (~200 candidates accepted), and then attend a 3 hour career fair with 8 participating companies, and lastly interview in order to receive an offer. There were about ~200 candidates around 20 candidates were in the cohort.
